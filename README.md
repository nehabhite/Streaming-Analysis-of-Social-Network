Streaming Analysis of Social Network using Advance Database methods

Data is the new oil. Data is being collected at Data warehouses across the world to extract
meaningful information. However, to process and store huge volume of data is a complicated
process as data can be in different format and size. We need a system to process the data
efficiently which can be used across different business verticals to increase the productivity
and effectiveness of the business.
One of the major factors contributing to huge data production are the social networking sites.
The challenge in this is how do we gather, process, and maintain user data. The underlying
motivation behind this idea is to collect all these real time data from multiple sources in a single
platform and use it for streaming online, thereby showing the related trending data based on
current popularity. For example. If #Covidvaccines
is
the most popular
tweet, then
our project will extract all the data from all connected sources static huge data or even from
APIs like YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Spotify etc. And display all the data together in our
web page. We are also planning to visualize the trending data using different data visualization
tools. This project will help users, who want quicker access to trending topics and, instead of
visiting each site, will look for all relevant data from various sources and thus save a lot of
search time.
To solve this problem, we plan to use an ETL system which means Extract, Transform, and
Load. Extraction includes getting the raw data (structured, semi-structured, and unstructured
data) from various sources or systems. Applying rules to get the information from the data we
have is known as Transform and then finally load the result to a data warehouse. We can use
ETL to help businesses which rely on analyzing the interests of people based on their to
find future market trends and many more. This tool
helps
them collect
the
data from
search, various sources and filter it with the required fields to make better recommendations
based on user interest
